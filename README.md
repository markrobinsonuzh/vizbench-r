# vizbench-r

This repo is where the code to call ALL R functions/packages is for the vizbench benchmark (designed by Jessica Jingyi Li's group and in particular, Zhiqian Zai and Qingyang Wang). For the omnibenchmark side, it's organized as a master repo that handles all (R) aspects, from deriving the datasets (usually, from public repos), running preprocessing methods (normalization, integration), and running visualization methods and then computing metrics.

TODO: add some docs here to this page to highlight how all the arguments are handled/designed.
